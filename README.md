# DOCKER TUTORIALS

## WHAT IS DOCKER
Docker is a platform that enables the developers to build, package and deploy an application quickly and efficiently by using containerization technology. It is solving the problem of "it works on my machine" by providing a consistent environment for the application to run, regardless of where it is deployed.

So Docker containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies into a single unit that can run anywhere, be it on a developer's laptop, on-premises data center, or in the cloud, thus ensuring that the application runs reliably on any system.


## WHY DO WE NEED DOCKER

Suppose that we are creating an application, so it is an obvious fact that there are dependencies that are required for the application to run. These dependencies can be anything like a specific version of a programming language, libraries, packages, os, etc. Now, if we want to deploy this application on another machine, we need to make sure that all these dependencies are installed on that machine as well. This can be a tedious task and can lead to errors if any dependency is missing or incompatible.

Hence we introduce the concept of Docker, which helps us solve this problem.


## ADVANTAGES OF USING DOCKER
1. Portability: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, making it easy to move applications between different environments.
2. Consistency: Docker ensures that the application runs the same way in different environments, reducing the chances of errors due to environment differences.
3. Isolation: Docker containers provide a level of isolation between applications, ensuring that they do not interfere with each other.
4. Scalability: Docker makes it easy to scale applications up or down by adding or removing containers as needed.
5. Efficiency: Docker containers are lightweight and use fewer resources compared to traditional virtual machines, making them more efficient.


## Why not use Virtual Machines (VMs)
While both Docker containers and Virtual Machines (VMs) provide isolation for applications, there are several reasons why Docker is often preferred over VMs:

1. Lightweight: Docker containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them much lighter in terms of resource usage compared to VMs, which require a full guest OS for each instance.

2. Faster Startup: Docker containers can start up in seconds, while VMs can take minutes to boot up since they need to load a full OS.

3. Better Resource Utilization: Docker allows for higher density of applications on a single host since containers use fewer resources compared to VMs.

4. Easier Management: Docker provides a simpler and more efficient way to manage application dependencies and configurations through Dockerfiles and images, whereas VMs often require more complex management tools.

So in simple terms, Virtual Machines are like running multiple computers on a single physical machine, each with its own operating system, while Docker containers are like running multiple applications on a single operating system, sharing the same kernel. This makes Docker more efficient and faster for deploying applications.
